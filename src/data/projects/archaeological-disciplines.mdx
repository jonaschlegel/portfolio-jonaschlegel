# Exploring Archaeological Disciplines – A Comic-Style Illustration Series

This project is a comic art–style illustration series designed to explore the diversity of disciplines within archaeology, with the aim of breaking the stereotype that archaeology is solely a humanities or social studies field. Each illustration highlights a specific branch of archaeology, presenting it in a fun, accessible manner that appeals to a broad audience.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this series is to inform and educate the public about the various specialised areas of archaeology, using a comic-style approach to simplify complex academic disciplines. The goal is to demonstrate that archaeology intersects with various fields such as science, technology, and interdisciplinary studies.

- **Public Engagement**: To reach a general audience unfamiliar with the broader aspects of archaeology.
- **Education**: To provide a visual tool that can be used in classrooms or educational environments, making complex subjects more approachable.
- **Social Media Outreach**: To share and grow awareness through platforms like Instagram, making archaeology more accessible through engaging visual content.

## Challenges

This project faces the challenge of simplifying highly technical and academic topics without diluting the accuracy or importance of the disciplines:

- **Balancing Simplicity and Accuracy**: The illustrations must communicate key ideas without losing scientific integrity.
- **Audience Reach**: Ensuring the content is engaging enough to capture both academic and non-academic audiences, particularly through platforms like Instagram.
- **Visual Consistency**: Creating a consistent, recognisable style that can be easily associated with each archaeological discipline while maintaining clarity in the information being presented.

## Target Group & Pain Points

This project is designed for a wide range of audiences:

- **General Public**: People interested in archaeology but often unaware of its interdisciplinary nature and the scientific methods used.
- **Students**: Those studying archaeology or history who benefit from visual aids to better understand specialised fields.
- **Science Communicators**: Looking for simplified ways to present technical topics to a broader audience.
- **Illustrators**: Artists seeking inspiration or interested in combining illustration with educational content, particularly in archaeology.

## Comic-Style Illustrations

The illustrations in this series highlight different branches of archaeology:

1. **Archaeobotany**: The study of plant remains from archaeological sites. Archaeobotanists identify ancient crop varieties by examining pollen and seeds.
2. **Forensic Archaeology**: Applies archaeological methods to modern and historical crime scene investigations. Forensic archaeologists often collaborate with law enforcement to locate and excavate human remains.
3. **Kurgan Archaeology**: Focuses on burial mounds (kurgans) found across the Eurasian steppes, associated with early Indo-European cultures.
4. **Jōmon Archaeology**: Focuses on the Jōmon period in Japan, known for its distinctive pottery and early sedentary communities.
