<h3>Reconstruction of Roman-Era Burial</h3>

This project showcases a detailed reconstruction of a Roman-era burial site, featuring two skeletons in an embrace, buried atop a horse. This scientifically accurate illustration was created based on archaeological findings and interdisciplinary research, which was published alongside academic papers and featured in media outlets. The illustration plays a crucial role in communicating the context and significance of the burial to both academic audiences and the general public.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project was to visually reconstruct the burial, based on the excavation findings, in a way that both archaeologists and the public could appreciate the complexity of the burial context. The goal was to create a compelling visual that captures the human element of the burial while ensuring scientific accuracy.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Academic Use</strong>: To provide an illustration that supports archaeological research papers and interdisciplinary analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Public Engagement</strong>: To create a visual representation that can be used in media or exhibitions, bringing the past to life for a wider audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Educational Tool</strong>: To offer a scientifically accurate depiction for use in museums, exhibitions, or lectures.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges

The project encountered several challenges in ensuring that the illustration accurately represented the archaeological findings while also being accessible to a non-specialist audience:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accuracy and Artistic Representation</strong>: Balancing the need for precise scientific details while also making the illustration engaging and understandable to the public.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Communication</strong>: Conveying the significance of the burial in a single image, without overwhelming viewers with too many technical details.</li>
  <li><strong>Contextual Clarity</strong>: Ensuring the depiction of the burial reflected its broader archaeological context and the cultural significance of the interment with a horse.</li>
</ul>

## Target Group & Pain Points

This project was intended for various groups who require visual representation to understand archaeological contexts:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Archaeologists and Researchers</strong>: Looking for scientifically accurate illustrations to accompany academic papers, often struggling to find well-documented visuals that maintain a high standard of accuracy.</li>
  <li><strong>The General Public</strong>: Interested in understanding archaeological finds, but often unable to interpret complex burial sites without clear, accessible visual aids.</li>
  <li><strong>Museums and Exhibitions</strong>: Seeking high-quality visual materials that both educate and engage visitors, while maintaining historical accuracy.</li>
</ul>
