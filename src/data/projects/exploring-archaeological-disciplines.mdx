<h3>Exploring Archaeological Disciplines – A Comic-Style Illustration Series</h3>

This project is a comic art–style illustration series designed to explore the diversity of disciplines within archaeology, with the aim of breaking the stereotype that archaeology is solely a humanities or social studies field. Each illustration highlights a specific branch of archaeology, presenting it in a fun, accessible manner that appeals to a broad audience.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this series is to inform and educate the public about the various specialised areas of archaeology, using a comic-style approach to simplify complex academic disciplines. The goal is to demonstrate that archaeology intersects with various fields such as science, technology, and interdisciplinary studies.

<ul >
  <li><strong>Public Engagement</strong>: To reach a general audience unfamiliar with the broader aspects of archaeology.</li>
  <li><strong>Education</strong>: To provide a visual tool that can be used in classrooms or educational environments, making complex subjects more approachable.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Media Outreach</strong>: To share and grow awareness through platforms like Instagram, making archaeology more accessible through engaging visual content.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges

This project faces the challenge of simplifying highly technical and academic topics without diluting the accuracy or importance of the disciplines:

<ul >
  <li><strong>Balancing Simplicity and Accuracy</strong>: The illustrations must communicate key ideas without losing scientific integrity.</li>
  <li><strong>Audience Reach</strong>: Ensuring the content is engaging enough to capture both academic and non-academic audiences, particularly through platforms like Instagram.</li>
  <li><strong>Visual Consistency</strong>: Creating a consistent, recognisable style that can be easily associated with each archaeological discipline while maintaining clarity in the information being presented.</li>
</ul>

## Target Group & Pain Points

This project is designed for a wide range of audiences:

<ul >
  <li><strong>General Public</strong>: People interested in archaeology but often unaware of its interdisciplinary nature and the scientific methods used.</li>
  <li><strong>Students</strong>: Those studying archaeology or history who benefit from visual aids to better understand specialised fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Science Communicators</strong>: Looking for simplified ways to present technical topics to a broader audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Illustrators</strong>: Artists seeking inspiration or interested in combining illustration with educational content, particularly in archaeology.</li>
</ul>

## Comic-Style Illustrations

The illustrations in this series highlight different branches of archaeology:

<ol >
  <li><strong>Archaeobotany</strong>: The study of plant remains from archaeological sites. Archaeobotanists identify ancient crop varieties by examining pollen and seeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Forensic Archaeology</strong>: Applies archaeological methods to modern and historical crime scene investigations. Forensic archaeologists often collaborate with law enforcement to locate and excavate human remains.</li>
  <li><strong>Kurgan Archaeology</strong>: Focuses on burial mounds (kurgans) found across the Eurasian steppes, associated with early Indo-European cultures.</li>
  <li><strong>Jōmon Archaeology</strong>: Focuses on the Jōmon period in Japan, known for its distinctive pottery and early sedentary communities.</li>
</ol>
